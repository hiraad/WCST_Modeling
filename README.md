# Modelling the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task

â€¢ Master Thesis project under supervision of [Holger Schultheis](https://bscc.spatial-cognition.de/schultheis). Modelling a special variation of the [WCST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Card_Sorting_Test) with various approaches, to gain insights on the relativity of spatial-information in analogical reasoning, problem solving and decision making.  
Continued on the results of a previously conducted experiment, and based on a sequential learning model of the
experiment by [Anthony J. Bishara](https://psychology.cofc.edu/about/faculty-and-staff/bishara-anthony.php)

Ps: This project is currently under development on a private repository in gitlab, I only update github occasionally, some features (specially the "runSimulation.py"!) might not work properly, use speedRun.py instead.
